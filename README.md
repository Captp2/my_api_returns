REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.3.1"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.



About the REST API :

Right now the API concerns two entities : User and Task, in a one-to-many relation.

If you want to add a new Entity :

      -Create the entity. 
      -Create the related Controller.
      -Add the controller in the urlManager component.
      -Add your personnal verification rules.
      
The REST API deals with the following URL (for users and tasks both) :

    GET /users: list all users page by page;
    HEAD /users: show the overview information of user listing;
    POST /users: create a new user;
    GET /users/123: return the details of the user 123;
    HEAD /users/123: show the overview information of user 123;
    PATCH /users/123 and PUT /users/123: update the user 123;
    DELETE /users/123: delete the user 123;
    OPTIONS /users: show the supported verbs regarding endpoint /users;
    OPTIONS /users/123: show the supported verbs regarding endpoint /users/123.

If you want to add a task, make sure the user from the user_id exists.

Have fun !
